- Send an email to Bryan Wang about the research project 
- QHD need to catch up and write some update to John.

- Kreyszig Chapter 3 and exercises
- Finish assignment 1 for DG
- Finish Homework 2 for Fractals
- Read Chapter 1 of Deep Reinforcement learning
- Read Chapter 12 of Information Geometry
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk1
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk2
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk3
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk4

Idea that I have in mind
- Adaptive control
- PDE and its relation to normal distribution and adverse pde with fat tail distribution
- Multiagent RL for QHD
- Information gemometry, natural gradient descent and its relation to RL
- Semilinear DP, Read papers from Bertsekas.
- 




# Weekly Goal (2025/03/17 - 03/23)
- QHD need to catch up and write some update to John. 
- Kreyszig Chapter 3 and exercises
- Finish Reading DP2 Chapter 1.2 (think why \sigma-chain complete + order continuous has the same power as chain complete + order preserving, i.e., we get up a little bit of completeness but we require more than order preserving to order continuity. what is that a little bit difference between order preserving and order continuity? And can we have \sigma-chain complete and order preserving work? )
- (Done) ~~Finish Reading DP2 Chapter 3.1.1.2-3.1.1.3~~
- (Done) ~~Read the RL survey paper and get a sense of possible research direction~~ --> adaptive control might be lead to QHD
- (Done) ~~Find a possible research direction between differential geometry and RL and talk to Bryan~~ --> Natural Policy Gradient
- Finish assignment 1 for DG
- ~~Finish weekly assignment for week 5 for econometric~~
- ~~Complete lecture recording on DG wk1~~
- ~~Complete lecture recording on DG wk2~~
- ~~Complete lecture recording on DG wk3~~
- ~~Complete lecture recording on DG wk4~~
- ~~Complete lecture recording on DG wk5~~
The lecture for DG is very useless. Refer to the book to get a deeper understanding. Use the lecture only for direction. 

- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk1
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk2
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk3
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk4
- Complete lecture recording on fractals wk5

- List the calender for upcoming assignment (Fractals assignment 2, network video, ECMT week 6 assignment, )

- Read about the information geomtry and its relation to RL, write an email to Bryan Wang to discuss potential research direction.
