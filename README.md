# Weekly Goal (2025/03/17 - 03/23)
- QHD need to catch up and write some update to John. 
- Kreyszig Chapter 3 and exercises
- Finish Reading DP2 Chapter 1.2 (think why \sigma-chain complete + order continuous has the same power as chain complete + order preserving, i.e., we get up a little bit of completeness but we require more than order preserving to order continuity. what is that a little bit difference between order preserving and order continuity? And can we have \sigma-chain complete and order preserving work? )
- (Done) ~~Finish Reading DP2 Chapter 3.1.1.2-3.1.1.3~~
- (Done) ~~Read the RL survey paper and get a sense of possible research direction~~ --> adaptive control might be lead to QHD
- (Done) ~~Find a possible research direction between differential geometry and RL and talk to Bryan~~ --> Natural Policy Gradient
