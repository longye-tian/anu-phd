\section{Normed Space. Banach Space}

\begin{frame}{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Normed space
    \item Banach space
    \item four axioms of the norm
    \item metric induced by the norm
    \item norm is continuous
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Not every metric can be induced by a norm}
    \begin{theorem}
        A metric $d$ induced by a norm on a normed space $X$ satisfy
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Translation invariance 
            $$
            d(x+a, y+a) = d(x,y)
            $$
            \item Absolute homogeneity
            $$
            d(ax,ay) = |a|d(x,y)
            $$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}
    Hence, any metric that does not have these two properties cannot be induced by a norm. (e.g. discrete metric)
